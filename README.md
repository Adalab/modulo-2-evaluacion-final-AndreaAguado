# Module # 1 - Final evaluation exercise

Hi! I'm Andrea Aguado :) and this repository was made to complete the final exercise of the Module 1 at the Adalab programming course.
This exercise is meant to show my newly acquired skills in **HTML, CSS and Javascript** ðŸ˜Š
I parted from a pre-made Starter Kit that included pretty much everything needed to create the proyect, like an HTML template engine, the SASS preprocessor and much more.

In the Kit there are 3 types of files and folders:

- The files that are loose in the repository root, such as _gulpfile.js, package.json_... They are the configuration of the project and we do not need to modify them.
- The `src/` folder: are the files of our web page, such as **HTML, CSS, JS...**
- The `public/` and `docs/` folders, which are automatically generated when we start the project. Kit reads the files inside `src/`, processes them and generates them inside `public/` and `docs/`.

For this first evaluation I had to work with the contents of the `src/` folder, making the HTML structure, applying the SCSS styles and coding the JS my own from scratch ðŸ’ª.

## Quick Start Guide

> **NOTE:** You need to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed to work with this Starter Kit:

### Steps to follow every time we want to start a project from scratch:

1. \*\*Create your own repository.
1. Download this **Starter kit from GitHub**.
1. **Copy all the files** from this Starter kit to the root folder of your repository.
1. **Open a terminal** in the root folder of your repository.
1. **Install the local dependencies** by running in the terminal the command:

```bash
npm install
```

### Steps to start the project:

Once we have installed the dependencies, let's start the project. \*\*The project has to be started every time you start programming:

```bash
npm start
```

This command:

- **Opens a Chrome window and displays your web page**, just like when using the VS Code Live Server plugin.
- It also **watches** all the files inside the `src/` folder, so that every time you modify a file it **refreshes your page in Chrome**.
- It also **processes the files** HTML, SASS / CSS and JS and **generates and saves them in the `public/`** folder. For example:
  - Converts SASS files to CSS.
  - Combine the different HTML files and group them into one or several HTML files.

After running `npm start` you can start editing all files inside the `src/` folder and program comfortably.
